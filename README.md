# Exploring D-Wave Quantum Annealing

D-Wave is kind enough to give developers 1 minute per month of compute time on their processors.  The exchange is that the developer open-source some repository.  So this is my open source repository to get my free compute time!

This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook ``solving_linear_equations.ipynb`` that demonstrates solving a system of linear equations with binary variables.  The notebook describes translating the system of linear equations to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and solves a simple example.
